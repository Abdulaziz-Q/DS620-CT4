Critical Thinking Assignment 4 is part of DS620 (Data Visualization) course

### CT4: Time Series and Temporal Data

In this critical thinking, our mission is to create Python graphics for time series and temporal data. Explain the distinctions between time series and temporal data, and create a concise overview of what these representations signify to the end-user. The dataset used for this critical thinking was retrieved from the Yahoo finance (finance.yahoo.com) for the historical prices of Bitcoin-USD data.
